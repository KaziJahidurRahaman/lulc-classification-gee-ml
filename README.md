<h1>LULC Classification GEE ML</h1>
<h2>Land Use Land Class classification by Random Forest, SVM, and ANN using Sentinel 2 Imagery in Google Earth Python API</h2>
<p>The project includes the code for doing a LULC classification based on RF, SVM and ANN on GEE. The idea of using GEE is to overcome the dependency of downloading data individually for each AOI. In this code, the user only specifies the <i>AOI, Date for which user wants to classify, Cloud cover, and the Training dataset</i>.</p>
<p>The data selection, preprocessing, model training, and output generation is handled by the code. </p>
